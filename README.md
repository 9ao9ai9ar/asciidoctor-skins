# asciidoctor-skins: CSS stylesheets for asciidoctor

Markdown is superbly simple. Perfect for writing quick notes and pages with a basic structure. Asciidoctor is superbly sophisticated. Where markdown fails, asciidoc/asciidoctor allows you to document things with ease, fine grain control and a civilised demeanor, worlds away from hair wrenching word processors.

But the default asciidoc "look" may be getting boring.

Right! Let's fix that.

## Usage

1. If you have no idea what asciidoctor is, check out their fabulous project [here](http://asciidoctor.org/).
2. Once you've got an .adoc document going, download the asciidoctor.css and a css skin file of your choice into your project directory.
3. In your adoc file, add the following line:
`:stylesheet: Your_Chosen_Stylesheet.css`

4. Render your html file by running `asciidoctor sample.adoc`
5. Et voil√†! Your beautiful web page based document is rendered.
